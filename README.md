# SummerClassProject 

---

This repositry is what the author have done when attending the **Algebra and Formalization Summer School** held by Peking University and Renmin University of China in summer 2025. The course comes with *two parts*. The first part in **RUC** consists of three close-related portions, which are the abstract algebra about the numbers lectured by **Shanwen Wang**, course about type theory and using lean to construct numbers by **Riccardo Brasca**, and theorem proving in lean by **student assistants from RUC and PKU**. The second part are held in **PKU**, consisting the Field Extention and Galois Theory by **Huayi Chen** and the Formalize Finite Field on Lean. 


## Brief Introducion 
This course is friendly to those who try to learn **Lean** for the first time. The following are the simple introduction of the three parts.

### Part 1 (RUC)
- [A Journey to the World of Numbers (Mathematics)](./Math_Notes/Numbers) 
- [A Journey to the World of Numbers (Lean)](./Lean_Code/Numbers)
- [Theorem Proving in Lean](./Lean_Code/Theorem_Proving_in_Lean/)


### Part 2 (PKU)
- [Field Extention and Galois Theory](./Math_Notes/Galois_Theory/)
- [Formalize Finite Field on Lean](./Lean_Code/Final_Presentation/)
