# Lean_Summer_School_2025


This repository is what the author have done when attending the *Algebra and Formalization Summer School* held by Peking University and Renmin University of China in summer 2025. 

The course comes with **two parts**. 

The first part in **RUC** consists of three close-related portions, which are the abstract algebra about the numbers lectured by *Shanwen Wang*, course about type theory and using lean to construct numbers by *Riccardo Brasca*, and theorem proving in lean by student assistants from RUC and PKU. 

The second part are held in **PKU**, consisting the Field Extention and Galois Theory by *Huayi Chen* and the Formalize Finite Field on Lean. 


## Brief Introducion 
This course is friendly to those who try to learn **Lean** for the first time. The following are the simple introduction of the three parts.


### Part 1 (RUC)
- [A Journey to the World of Numbers (Mathematics)](./Math_Notes/Numbers)
  - Here we start from semigroup to field, constructing the numbers from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{R}$, and we also talk about the topology, normed linear space and number theory.
- [A Journey to the World of Numbers (Lean)](./Lean_Code/Numbers)
  - In this part we try to construct numbers from $\N$ to $\R$ and even $\mathbb{C}$ in Lean.
- [Theorem Proving in Lean](./Lean_Code/Theorem_Proving_in_Lean/)
  - More things about Lean, in fact this can be seen as an Introduction Tutorial for Lean.


### Part 2 (PKU)
- [Field Extention and Galois Theory](./Math_Notes/Galois_Theory/)
  - We have learned more knowledge of algebra in this stage.
- [Formalize Finite Field on Lean](./Lean_Code/Final_Presentation/)
  - In this part, we don't do any teaching, instead we aim to formalize some theorems and exercises in [Finite Field](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/finite-fields/75BDAA74ABAE713196E718392B9E5E72). This repository contains the formalizing work of my team.

## Getting Started Advice
- Read more official documentation and Lean Community resources.
- Seek help from the Zulip community for any questions; members are enthusiastic and willing to help.
- Study the mathlib library extensively; mimicking its code style yields significant benefits.
- Before formalizing in Lean, fully understand the mathematical process first.


**Hope you enjoy learning Lean! Now it's time to start your journey of mathematic formalization!**

**Happy formalizing! Let the journey begin!** ðŸš€
